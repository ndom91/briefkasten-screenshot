## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this yourself, you'll only need somewhere to host a Next.js application, like Vercel, Netlify, or a server of your own.

1. Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone ssh://github.com/ndom91/briefkasten-screenshot
$ cd briefkasten-screenshot
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
$ pnpm install
```

3. Run the Next.js API

```sh
$ pnpm start
```

You should now have an API Route up and running at [`http://localhost:3000/api/bookmarks/image`](http://localhost:3000/api/bookmarks/image)
